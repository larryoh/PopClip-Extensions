### MailPop ###

An extension for [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/ "PopClip for Mac") that sends the selected text in Mail.app message as a new note to Evernote.app.

Based on an AppleScript to do the same without PopClip. More details [here](http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/send-selected-mail-message-to-evernote-with-source-url/ "Send Selected Mail Message To Evernote With Source URL").
